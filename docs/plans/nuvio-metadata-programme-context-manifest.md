## Contract disposition

- `contracts/registry/v1/nuvio-metadata-programme-preview.yaml` is planning data and is not imported by the runtime registry or generators.
- Each owning milestone promotes only implemented capabilities into `contracts/registry/v1/capabilities.yaml` with application ownership, OpenAPI, applicable AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, JSON-LD or reasoned `N/A`, generated SDK, CLI discovery, scopes, typed problems, examples, knowledge, and UAT evidence.
- The focused `cargo xtask integration check` path is implemented in M1 using existing xtask, contract types, loopback fixtures, and `--output human|json` conventions.
- Nuvio Desktop and NuvioTV use their installed native HTTP/serialization stacks against the dual-licensed plain contract and fixtures. No Kotlin SDK or copied Fasti implementation is introduced.
- Public Stremio transport covers only explicitly allowlisted catalog and metadata reads. Nuvio Cloud and authenticated Fasti-provider lanes own writes.

Every Fasti slice targets `dev` from its accepted predecessor. One writer owns each migration number, authored registry set, generated contract set, SDK surface, and Workbench composition slice. Nuvio client work uses pinned upstream repository branches and cannot claim release until accepted in a published upstream build.

## Threat and evidence map

The controlling threat model is canonical plan sections 23, 39, and 54. Mandatory negative evidence includes credential non-disclosure, governed egress, cross-profile denial, candidate re-fetch, inert imported URLs, bounded parsing, private/public cache separation, token-rotation fault injection, complete idempotency authority scope, storage admission quotas, stream invalidation, and restore-generation quarantine.

The programme acceptance map is `tests/conformance/uat-matrix.csv` rows `MDN-001` through `MDN-060`. Deterministic fixtures prove semantics. Redacted live acceptance separately proves TMDB, MDBList, Nuvio Cloud, Nuvio Desktop, and NuvioTV transport on exact revisions. Neither class substitutes for the other.

## M0 verification

```text
git rev-parse HEAD HEAD^{tree}
git diff --check
bun YAML parse + uniqueness/count check: 51 capabilities, 35 problems, 8 events
bun CSV uniqueness/count check: 140 total UAT rows, 60 MDN programme rows
cargo xtask contract verify --locked
```

M0 changes planning, design, preview-contract, and acceptance-evidence files only. It does not activate a capability, change a schema, alter generated contracts, or modify production behavior.

| Delivery evidence | 22 exact-head checks passed; zero unresolved review threads; the merged tree is byte-identical to the reviewed PR tree. |

M3 publishes schema v15 and archive v5. Archive v4 remains frozen at its
29-stream prefix. Archive v5 retains that prefix and appends five M3 streams,
for 34 streams total. Historical restore must continue to accept archive v5
with migration version 15. M4 owns the single append-only schema v16 migration.
Archive v6 is not allocated; M4 may advance the archive only if frozen durable
Search state proves that portability requires it.

The merged M3 invariants are:

- stable Record identity and purpose-specific identity routes;
- profile defaults plus per-client anime grouping overrides without Record or Chronicle re-keying;
- workspace-wide operation identity with replay bound to actor client, profile, action scope, and semantic digest;
- bounded lifecycle loading that splits valid multi-Record batches and fails closed when one Record exceeds the per-Record limit;
- literal same-origin browser-smoke endpoints with the existing CSRF, method, body, and credential behavior;
- unchanged C1 TrailBase exchange, opaque Fasti browser-session, and zeroizing process-memory PKCE boundary;
- unchanged M2 provider-operation serialization and bounded outbound policy.

M4 is now the sole writer for schema v16, Search/provider candidate types,
identity-routing integration, atomic Record actions, capability registry and
generators, generated contracts, API, SDK, hosts, Workbench composition,
portability extensions, and the related governed documentation and tests.
M8 may prepare or edit only its isolated metadata-refresh leaf after explicit
file allocation; it must not touch shared provider, metadata, contract, host,
or UI composition files until M4 merges. M5 remains read-only preparation until
M4 and the minimum Collections membership predecessor merge.

Codex Security is intentionally disabled for this programme. Exact-diff review,
canonical CI, CodeQL, Codacy, CodeRabbit, advisory checks, browser QA, OCI,
coverage, documentation, contract parity, and both low-hardware envelopes are
the retained M3 evidence.

### M4 provider paging checkpoint — 2026-09-04

The shared provider runtime now accepts an explicit upstream page and TMDB
locale. It preserves each normalized page and response digest, validates the
returned TMDB page, and returns a bounded continuation. The existing desktop
entry point uses the same implementation. TMDB retains all 20 upstream results;
Google Books requests 10. Empty raw pages stop traversal; pages containing only
filtered candidates can continue. Search query debug output is redacted.

Primary sources inspected on 2026-09-04:
[TMDB multi-search](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-multi),
[TMDB page limits](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/errors), and
[Google Books volume search](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/reference/volumes/list).
Provider runtime tests pass (27), strict clippy passes, and an independent
read-only review found no actionable defect (15 focused provider tests pass).
This evidence covers parsing, URL construction, bounds, and credential ordering;
it does not prove live upstream paging or completed M4 Search.

The next implementation work is durable, authorized candidate receipts and
atomic Record actions; selected-Record metadata loading; the local search index;
and API/SDK/host/UI integration. Stable public cursors must refer to persisted
ordering, not directly to changing upstream pages. Cross-page duplicate handling,
offline cache, partial results, real browser QA, and the 10,000-Record performance
gate remain required before M4 delivery. Schema remains v15 at this checkpoint;
M4 retains allocation v16 and the archive decision is still unallocated.

Parallel preparation confirmed reuse of the M2 projection resolver and provider
locks, M3 workspace-wide operation replay semantics, and the existing C1 browser
authentication boundary. SQLite already compiles FTS5; no dependency is needed.
C2 owns its isolated Access credential modules and additive Access exports in
domain/application lib.rs. M4 owns Search exports and all previously allocated
shared surfaces. Codex Security remains disabled.

### M4 query and selected metadata checkpoint — 2026-09-04

Provider paging is committed at `81b7cbea`; shared domain query admission is
committed at `b8249540`. `SearchQuery` owns the 256-byte UTF-8 bound, whitespace
and control-character checks, and redacted debug representation. Provider URL
construction consumes the validated value. No query rewrite discards upstream
search syntax.

Record metadata loading now accepts the caller's bounded, typed Record IDs,
instead of selecting the workspace's first 500 Records again. The current
Record-list caller uses this shared loader. It retains the M2 projection and
lifecycle resolver. The regression selects Record 501, tests duplicate input
IDs, excludes a populated foreign-workspace Record, preserves profile override
isolation, and checks empty and oversized batches. This prepares local Search
to resolve its actual matches without a second metadata implementation.

Verification: domain 88 tests pass; provider runtime 27 tests pass; store 292
tests pass with three subprocess-worker tests ignored by design. Strict clippy
passes for all targets in these three crates. Store snapshot tests require
`TMPDIR=/mnt/secondary-ssd/cache/home/tmp` on this host: the default temporary
path traverses a symlink and correctly fails SQLite's no-follow check. The
physical-path rerun passes without changing protection or test assertions.
Independent review of the selected-ID loader found no actionable issue.

No M4 runtime Search endpoint, durable candidate cache, action receipt, local
index, migration, archive format, or browser flow is activated by these commits.
Those implementation and verification requirements remain in the active M4
workfront above. The full programme goal remains active.

### M4 evidence admission and shared hardening checkpoint — 2026-09-04

Codex Security remains intentionally skipped. Native independent review and
negative tests remain active; no external AI key was used. The commander keeps
sole write ownership of M4 shared surfaces. Parallel agents reviewed evidence
admission, optimized secret erasure, typed-ID parsing, and the v15 archive
compatibility prerequisite. The next bounded read-only review maps Search
partition inputs to existing authorization and provider-configuration owners.

Three isolated shared-owner commits were handed to C2 for cherry-pick:

- `f46e5de8c94d6e31d43cc0e0a78f61ea7a501d08`: frozen executable PAT resource
  `pat_` and immutable consent revision `cnr_` identifiers. Neither is a bearer
  secret. No Search candidate identifier is included in that handoff.
- `fee9059d0a59d8b26bacbfbd8568636f4ec92ff3`: reuse existing `zeroize` for
  `SecretMaterial::drop` and enable the installed SHA-256 zeroizing feature.
  A compile-time regression requires `Sha256: ZeroizeOnDrop`. Independent
  optimized compilation of the actual owner retained 32 volatile zero stores.
  This does not prove erasure of prior copies or exposed hexadecimal strings.
- `8657a9124609ffe767f2131399714f6e944aa357`: fix the pre-existing concrete-ID
  JSON deserialization bypass by routing through the existing strict `FromStr`.
  The reproduced bug accepted a Record or consent ID as a PAT ID. The generated
  test matrix now checks every concrete type against every registered prefix.
  This proves a validation defect and fix, not an authorization exploit.

The M4 application evidence owner now validates normalized candidate fields,
canonical provider coordinates, bounded JSON and image origins. Provider
normalization reuses the text/image predicates. Invalid optional artwork is
discarded without losing the candidate; persisted unsafe artwork is rejected.
Candidate identity uses a reserved `scr_` typed ID, not an invented Record ID.

Receipt partitions bind workspace, profile, stable actor, grant, query digest,
grant digest, provider-configuration digest and terms. Browser-session rotation
alone does not change the stable actor. Current authorization and configuration
must be recomputed by the service before comparing a persisted partition.
The caller's complete digest inputs are not yet implemented or verified.
Lifetime tests enforce 120-second freshness, 600-second stale-on-error without
stale-while-revalidate, and the independent 24-hour candidate-details expiry.
Clock rollback before creation and timestamp overflow fail closed.

Verification: 537 tests passed across domain (90), application (127), provider
runtime (28) and store (292), with three intentional store subprocess-worker
tests ignored. Strict all-target clippy passed for these four crates. The
additional published-v15 fingerprint regression passed independently and pins
`sha256:36720ca62ef606e52f960e71cb40452323269f14e4a4af984e2fe875279a155e`.
It explicitly runs the historical v1–v15 migration chain, not the current-version
dispatcher. All published migration functions remain unchanged.

Schema is still v15; M4 retains v16. No new archive version or shared-file
release has occurred. Before changing schema version, explicitly preserve
archive-v5/schema-v15 acceptance with that fingerprint and prove genuine old
archive restore plus forged-fingerprint rejection. Durable action receipts
must determine the archive disposition; disposable candidate cache is not a
reason to export node-local authority. Receipt persistence, atomic actions,
local index, API/SDK/host/Workbench integration and real browser QA remain
required M4 work, not completed capabilities. No programme scope is removed.

The completed partition-owner review fixes the next integration sequence:
derive query/page digests from exact validated text, provider, effective
locale/region, sorted grain filters and upstream page using version-tagged
deterministic serialization. Derive authorization digests inside the store
from current scopes and credential/subject epochs, not API-supplied digests.
Include provider capability version and current outbound policy: the existing
transport configuration digest covers only provider, capability and origin.
Acquire the existing shared provider lock; authorize before cache/network work;
reauthorize and compare current authority/provider state in the final commit
transaction. Locks do not prevent authorization changes during network I/O.
Preserve browser rotation without binding cache identity to its session ID.

TMDB Search currently sends locale but no region; Google Books Search sends
neither. Record actual upstream coordinates without claiming detail-specific
region semantics. A candidate detail fetch must separately authorize metadata
read; Record actions retain their existing mutation scopes. No new grant
revision or restore-generation API is allocated by this preparation. Existing
revocation is terminal; future in-place regrant needs its owner's explicit
generation contract. Also verified: all 29 contract unit tests passed after
the shared identifier parsing fix. M4 remains unmerged.
