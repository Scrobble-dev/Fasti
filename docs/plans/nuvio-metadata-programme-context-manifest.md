## Contract disposition

- `contracts/registry/v1/nuvio-metadata-programme-preview.yaml` is planning data and is not imported by the runtime registry or generators.
- Each owning milestone promotes only implemented capabilities into `contracts/registry/v1/capabilities.yaml` with application ownership, OpenAPI, applicable AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, JSON-LD or reasoned `N/A`, generated SDK, CLI discovery, scopes, typed problems, examples, knowledge, and UAT evidence.
- The focused `cargo xtask integration check` path is implemented in M1 using existing xtask, contract types, loopback fixtures, and `--output human|json` conventions.
- Nuvio Desktop and NuvioTV use their installed native HTTP/serialization stacks against the dual-licensed plain contract and fixtures. No Kotlin SDK or copied Fasti implementation is introduced.
- Public Stremio transport covers only explicitly allowlisted catalog and metadata reads. Nuvio Cloud and authenticated Fasti-provider lanes own writes.

Every Fasti slice targets `dev` from its accepted predecessor. One writer owns each migration number, authored registry set, generated contract set, SDK surface, and Workbench composition slice. Nuvio client work uses pinned upstream repository branches and cannot claim release until accepted in a published upstream build.

## Threat and evidence map

The controlling threat model is canonical plan sections 23, 39, and 54. Mandatory negative evidence includes credential non-disclosure, governed egress, cross-profile denial, candidate re-fetch, inert imported URLs, bounded parsing, private/public cache separation, token-rotation fault injection, complete idempotency authority scope, storage admission quotas, stream invalidation, and restore-generation quarantine.

The programme acceptance map is `tests/conformance/uat-matrix.csv` rows `MDN-001` through `MDN-060`. Deterministic fixtures prove semantics. Redacted live acceptance separately proves TMDB, MDBList, Nuvio Cloud, Nuvio Desktop, and NuvioTV transport on exact revisions. Neither class substitutes for the other.

## M0 verification

```text
git rev-parse HEAD HEAD^{tree}
git diff --check
bun YAML parse + uniqueness/count check: 51 capabilities, 35 problems, 8 events
bun CSV uniqueness/count check: 140 total UAT rows, 60 MDN programme rows
cargo xtask contract verify --locked
```

M0 changes planning, design, preview-contract, and acceptance-evidence files only. It does not activate a capability, change a schema, alter generated contracts, or modify production behavior.

| Delivery evidence | 22 exact-head checks passed; zero unresolved review threads; the merged tree is byte-identical to the reviewed PR tree. |

M3 publishes schema v15 and archive v5. Archive v4 remains frozen at its
29-stream prefix. Archive v5 retains that prefix and appends five M3 streams,
for 34 streams total. Historical restore must continue to accept archive v5
with migration version 15. M4 owns the single append-only schema v16 migration.
Archive v6 is not allocated; M4 may advance the archive only if frozen durable
Search state proves that portability requires it.

The merged M3 invariants are:

- stable Record identity and purpose-specific identity routes;
- profile defaults plus per-client anime grouping overrides without Record or Chronicle re-keying;
- workspace-wide operation identity with replay bound to actor client, profile, action scope, and semantic digest;
- bounded lifecycle loading that splits valid multi-Record batches and fails closed when one Record exceeds the per-Record limit;
- literal same-origin browser-smoke endpoints with the existing CSRF, method, body, and credential behavior;
- unchanged C1 TrailBase exchange, opaque Fasti browser-session, and zeroizing process-memory PKCE boundary;
- unchanged M2 provider-operation serialization and bounded outbound policy.

M4 is now the sole writer for schema v16, Search/provider candidate types,
identity-routing integration, atomic Record actions, capability registry and
generators, generated contracts, API, SDK, hosts, Workbench composition,
portability extensions, and the related governed documentation and tests.
M8 may prepare or edit only its isolated metadata-refresh leaf after explicit
file allocation; it must not touch shared provider, metadata, contract, host,
or UI composition files until M4 merges. M5 remains read-only preparation until
M4 and the minimum Collections membership predecessor merge.

Codex Security is intentionally disabled for this programme. Exact-diff review,
canonical CI, CodeQL, Codacy, CodeRabbit, advisory checks, browser QA, OCI,
coverage, documentation, contract parity, and both low-hardware envelopes are
the retained M3 evidence.

### M4 provider paging checkpoint — 2026-09-04

The shared provider runtime now accepts an explicit upstream page and TMDB
locale. It preserves each normalized page and response digest, validates the
returned TMDB page, and returns a bounded continuation. The existing desktop
entry point uses the same implementation. TMDB retains all 20 upstream results;
Google Books requests 10. Empty raw pages stop traversal; pages containing only
filtered candidates can continue. Search query debug output is redacted.

Primary sources inspected on 2026-09-04:
[TMDB multi-search](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-multi),
[TMDB page limits](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/errors), and
[Google Books volume search](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/reference/volumes/list).
Provider runtime tests pass (27), strict clippy passes, and an independent
read-only review found no actionable defect (15 focused provider tests pass).
This evidence covers parsing, URL construction, bounds, and credential ordering;
it does not prove live upstream paging or completed M4 Search.

The next implementation work is durable, authorized candidate receipts and
atomic Record actions; selected-Record metadata loading; the local search index;
and API/SDK/host/UI integration. Stable public cursors must refer to persisted
ordering, not directly to changing upstream pages. Cross-page duplicate handling,
offline cache, partial results, real browser QA, and the 10,000-Record performance
gate remain required before M4 delivery. Schema remains v15 at this checkpoint;
M4 retains allocation v16 and the archive decision is still unallocated.

Parallel preparation confirmed reuse of the M2 projection resolver and provider
locks, M3 workspace-wide operation replay semantics, and the existing C1 browser
authentication boundary. SQLite already compiles FTS5; no dependency is needed.
C2 owns its isolated Access credential modules and additive Access exports in
domain/application lib.rs. M4 owns Search exports and all previously allocated
shared surfaces. Codex Security remains disabled.
